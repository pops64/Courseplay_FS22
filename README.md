# Courseplay Beta with Chopper Support for Farming Simulator 2022

This is an unofficial version of CP that includes chopper support. It will be kept in sync to the offical repo as best as possible. If enough interest is shown further development will continue.
If using this version please post any bugs related to Combine/Chopper Drivers including their unloaders in this fork as there is enough of a departure from official CP that I will do my best to handle them. All other bugs try to reproduce them in the offical version and post in their fork. If not post them here and I will take a look

## What Works

* Chopper Support
* **Multiplayer support**
* Fieldwork and vine work with courses from the course generator.
* Course manager for saving/loading/renaming/moving and deleting of courses.
* Wrapping and collecting of bales with or without a course.
* Unloading of combines with unloaders.
* Creating heaps of sugar beets or other fruits on the field with the combine unloader.
* Unloading silo loaders, like the ``ROPA Maus`` and letting AD or Giants unload the trailer after that.
* Compacting of a bunker silo or pushing the chaff into the back of a silo.
* Let the combine unload into nearby trailers (combine self unload).
* Field work with up to 5 vehicles on the same course (multi tool course).
* Creating custom fields by recording a course or drawing on the AI Map.
* Course editor to edit fieldwork courses or custom field borders.
* Mod support with [AutoDrive](https://github.com/Stephan-S/FS22_AutoDrive):
  * Sending the fieldwork driver to refill seeds/fertilizers and so on.
  * Sending the fieldworker/ bale collector to unload collected straw and so on.
  * Sending the fieldwork driver to refuel or repair.
* Bale collector mod support for:
  * [Pallet Autoload Specialization](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=gb&mod_id=228819)

## Turning on Debug Channels

When there's an issue, you can turn on debug logging on the Courseplay vehicle settings page for each vehicle. This will
enable logging of debug information for only this vehicle. **Devs need those logs for troubleshooting and fixing bugs.**

What information is logged when you activated the debug logging for the vehicle depends on the active debug channels. This
are similar to those we had in CP 19, but the way to turn them on/off is different: you can bring up the debug channel menu
by pressing Shift+4, then use Shift+1 and Shift+3 to select a channel, and then Shift+2 to toggle the selected debug channel
(green is on).

Remember, you have to activate debug mode for the vehicle in the vehicle settings page, otherwise nothing is logged, even if
the channel is active.

## Developer version

Please be aware you're using a developer version, which may and will contain errors, bugs, mistakes and unfinished code. Chances are you computer will explode when using it. Twice. If you have no idea what "beta", "alpha", or "developer" means and entails, steer clear. The Courseplay team will not take any responsibility for crop destroyed, savegames deleted or baby pandas killed.

You have been warned.

If you're still ok with this, please remember to post possible issues that you find in the developer version. That's the only way we can find sources of error and fix them.
Be as specific as possible:

* tell us the version number
* only use the vehicles necessary, not 10 other ones at a time
* which vehicles are involved, what is the intended action?
* Post! The! Log! to [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [PasteBin](http://pastebin.com/)
